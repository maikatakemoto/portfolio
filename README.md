# My GitHub Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! Here, I’ve organized a collection of my past coding assignments, projects, and experiments. This repository serves as a showcase of my programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and the diversity of topics I’ve explored throughout my coursework and personal learning.

## About Me

Hi! I’m Maika, a Senior pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at Boston University. Aside from academics, I am involved in a number of on-campus organizations including BU Student Government, Fusion Dance Troupe, Charcoal Magazine, and CAS Dean's Host. 

Growing up in the competitive dance scene has led me to become an extremely creative individual whose interests lie in areas of digital marketing, UI/UX, and web design. In the future, I hope to put my social media content curation and computer programming skills to good use through pursuing a career that will involve both the arts and technology.

Feel free to explore the projects below and reach out if you have any questions or feedback!

## Repository Structure

This portfolio is organized by course or topic area. Each folder contains the relevant assignments or projects, along with any supporting files and documentation where applicable.

### Current Topics Included:
- **Data Analysis**: Scripts and projects related to visualization, and statistical analysis.
- **Algorithms**: Implementations of classic algorithms and data structures, along with problem-solving assignments.
- **Machine Learning & AI**: Projects focused on neural networks, optimization algorithms, and game AI strategies.
- **Web Development**: Code for web applications, showcasing both front-end and back-end skills.
- **Distributed Systems**: Implementations of distributed algorithms, such as Raft, along with concurrent programming assignments.
- **Computer Vision**: Implementations of filters used for photo editing, motion estimation techniques, and 3D animation.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to a project folder** to view the code and any specific instructions for running it.

3. **Dependencies**: Some projects may require specific libraries or frameworks to be installed. Detailed instructions can be found in the README files within each project folder.

## Highlights

Here are some examples of what you’ll find in this portfolio:

- **[Data Analytics in R]**: Projects involving data analysis using R, including work with real-world datasets, data visualizations, and statistical modeling.
- **[Game AI and Heuristics]**: Implementations of algorithms for game decision-making, including SEPIA AI heuristics and optimization strategies.
- **[Web Applications]**: Web development projects using Python, JavaScript, and MongoDB, such as an app that measures carbon emissions based on travel methods.
